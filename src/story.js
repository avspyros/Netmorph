My knowledge of web technologies at the time was not enough to offer a full stack solution to his admittedly very professional-looking mockups. Nevertheless, I could try to build the front end of the themes. He also introduced me to a back-end developer who was assigned the task of transforming the designs to complete WordPress themes and who would also mentor / guide me to achieve the desired result.'

After some back and forth with the other team members, we decided that I should try to implement the designs with Bootstrap (which was at version 3 or 4 at the time). Trying to build something with a CSS framework while not having a firm understading of CSS is never a good idea, so I struggled in the beginning. The fact that my supposed “mentor” did not seem really eager to help or was able to offer proper guidance was also a discouraging factor.'

The collaboration was not particularly efficient and in the end the 3 people team became a duo. After some thought and debate, my friend and I decided to overcome this obstacle by attempting to complete the project ourselves. I enlisted on a WordPress development Udemy course and step by step I was able to deliver the first working theme the following months.'

Regardless, it felt rewarding. Obviously, the WordPress themes did not have the functionality and the professionalism of commercial themes but they offered the bands a simple CMS solution with a sleek design according to their needs (though I doubt they are used or functional to this date as they were not maintained thereafter).'
